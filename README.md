# Simp

Simp is a fast and simple GPU-accelerated image manipulation program.

- 60 Hz. Avoid blocking for more than 16ms.
- Flicker free redrawing.
- Smooth resizing.
- Always use GPU-acceleration where possible.
- Desktop OS support.
- Basic image manipulation.

### Non Goals

- Powerful image manipulation (I am not making the next photoshop)
- Web/Mobile platform support.

1. Building with AVIF support requires the C library dav1d and is therefore not enabled by default.
2. SVGs are rastarized because Simp is primarily a bitmap image editor.
3. Most common cameras are supported but the colors may look weird because the standard curve may not fit all images.
4. HEIF/HEIC is not supported because it is currently very hard to link libheif on windows.

## System dependencies

System dependencies are only required at compile time.

### Linux

```shell
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libspeechd-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev
```

### dav1d

The dav1d library is required to be installed to build with AVIF support.

## Installation

### Cargo

```shell
cargo install simp --locked
```

### NetBSD
A pre-compiled binary is available from the official repositories. To install it, simply run:
```
pkgin install simp
```

### Latest from github

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kl4rry/simp --locked
```

The latest build is very likely buggy and unfinished.
You can always also just grab the latest binary from actions build artifacts.

### Manual

Just download the exe from the releases tab. No actual installation is required.

### The name

It's an acronym (S)imple (i)mage (m)anipulation (p)rogram.
